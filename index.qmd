# Motivation

Even though I had skimmed through [Introduction to Statistical Learning: with applications R](https://www.statlearning.com/) [@james_introduction_2021] once, I realized that I needed to keep detailed record of my projects, solutions, mistakes made and lessons learned, ensuring continuous improvement. This is the sole motivation for this project.

# Softwares, libraries, and other moving parts

Even though this is primarily for improving my skills in R, I will also be using python, STATA, *Observable* etc.

I will also try and put into practice what I had learned from the [Reproducible Research Fundamentals](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/upi7sd51sgnvjlz11fvjg/h/Nikhil%20Pakkattil%20Muraleedharan.pdf?rlkey=q2y8oz0p9vyuky0a32okjoxci&dl=0) course conducted by the World Bank's Development Impact (DIME) department.
