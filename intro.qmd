# Motivation

Even though I had skimmed through [Introduction to Statistical Learning: with applications R](https://www.statlearning.com/) once, I realized that I needed to keep detailed record of my projects, solutions, mistakes made and lessons learned, ensuring continuous improvement. This is the sole motivation for this project.

# Softwares, libraries, and other moving parts 

Even though this is primarily for improving my skills in R, I will also be using python, STATA, D3.js etc.
